# Adobe Experience Platform - Griffon plugin for Xamarin apps

## Notice of deprecation

Since *April 25, 2023*, [Apple has required](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jd9wcyov) apps submitted to the App Store to be built with Xcode 14.1 or later. The Experience Platform Mobile SDKs and extensions outlined below were built with prior versions of Xcode and are no longer compatible with iOS and iPadOS given Appleâ€™s current App Store requirements. Consequently, on *August 31, 2023*, Adobe will be deprecating support for the following Experience Platform Mobile SDKs and wrapper extensions:

- [ACP iOS SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/sdk-versions/#ios)
- [Cordova](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/sdk-versions/#cordova)
- [Flutter for ACP](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/sdk-versions/#flutter)
- [React Native for ACP](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/sdk-versions/#react-native)
- [Xamarin](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/sdk-versions/#xamarin)

After *August 31, 2023*, applications already submitted to the App Store that contain these SDKs and wrapper extensions will continue to operate, however, Adobe will not be providing security updates or bug fixes, and these SDKs and wrapper extensions will be provided as-is exclusive of any warranty, due to the App Store policy outlined above.

We encourage all customers to migrate to the latest Adobe Experience Platform versions of the Mobile SDK to ensure continued compatibility and support. Documentation for the latest versions of the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/current-sdk-versions/). The iOS migration guide can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/migrate-to-swift/).

## Prerequisites

Xamarin development requires the installation of [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Information regarding installation for Xamarin development is available for [Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/installation?view=vsmac-2019) or [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019).

An [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) and the latest version of Xcode (available from the App Store) are required if you are [building an iOS app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/installation?view=vsmac-2019).

## Installation

**Package Manager Installation**

The ACPGriffon Xamarin NuGet package for Android or iOS can be added to your project by right clicking the *_"Packages"_* folder within the project you are working on then selecting *_"Manage NuGet Packages"_*. In the window that opens, ensure that your selected source is `nuget.org` and search for *_"Adobe.ACP"_*. After selecting the Xamarin AEP SDK packages that are required, click on the *_"Add Packages"_* button. After exiting the "Add Packages" menu, right click the main solution or the "Packages" folder and select "Restore" to ensure the added packages are downloaded.

**Manual installation**

Local ACPGriffon NuGet packages can be created via the included Makefile. If building for the first time, run:

```
make setup
```

followed by:

```
make release
```

The created NuGet packages can be found in the bin directory. This directory can be added as a local nuget source and packages within the directory can be added to a Xamarin project following the steps in the "Package Manager Installation" above.

## Usage

The ACPGriffon binding can be opened by loading the ACPGriffonBinding.sln with Visual Studio. The following targets are available in the solution:

- Adobe.ACPGriffon.iOS - The ACPGriffon iOS bindings.
- Adobe.ACPGriffon.Android - The ACPGriffon Android binding.
- ACPGriffonTestApp - The Xamarin.Forms base app used by the iOS and Android test apps.
- ACPGriffonTestApp.iOS - The Xamarin.Forms based iOS manual test app.
- ACPGriffonTestApp.Android - The Xamarin.Forms based Android manual test app.
- ACPGriffoniOSUnitTests - iOS unit test app.
- ACPGriffonAndroidUnitTests - Android unit test app.

### [Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon)
##### Getting Griffon version:

**iOS and Android**

```c#
Console.WriteLine(ACPGriffon.ExtensionVersion());
```

##### Registering the extension with ACPCore:  

  ##### **iOS**

```c#
using Com.Adobe.Marketing.Mobile;

ACPGriffon.RegisterExtension();
ACPCore.Start(null);
```

  ##### Android

```c#

```

##### Starting the Griffon session:

```c#
NSUrl url = new NSUrl("acpgriffontestapp://link?adb_validation_sessionid=session_id");
ACPGriffon.StartSession(url);
```

**Android**

```c#
ACPGriffon.StartSession("acpgriffontestapp://link?adb_validation_sessionid=session_id");
```

## Running Tests

iOS and Android unit tests are included within the ACPGriffon binding solution. They must be built from within Visual Studio then manually triggered from the unit test app that is deployed to an iOS or Android device.
